"""Catalog: cross-dataset aggregate + per-dataset summary cards for the landing page.

The landing page answers "what datasets do we have, how big, which have
annotations" without making the operator drill into each source. Building that
has two cost tiers:

  * CHEAP facts (format/kind, task count, total episodes, cameras) come from each
    source's overview() — one S3 listing pass, fast enough to compute live.
  * DEEP facts (durations, annotation presence, per-task stats) need reading
    episode records. For the huge sources (32k+ episodes) that's a full scan, so
    it's run in a BACKGROUND thread and cached to disk; the card shows "computing"
    until ready, then serves the cached summary. Annotation presence is decided by
    sample-PROBING a handful of episodes (a source's format may support subtask
    labels but carry none), not by a format capability flag alone.

One CatalogBuilder holds the in-memory state; results are also persisted via
cache.put_json so they survive a restart.
